# Chainlink-Hackathon-Spring-2022

Einstein said, "Imagination is more important than knowledge, for knowledge is limited to all we know and understand, while imagination embraces the entire world, and all there ever will be to know and understand."

Imagination opens our minds to possibilities, and is the fertile ground in which our creativity can grow & flourish.

But...just like a plant needs water & nutrients, imagination needs knowledge in order to...well...coalesce into the structure (the stem, the trunk, the foundation) for what we're building...or to support the flower that'll bloom...definitely mixing metaphors here.

The point is, without deep knowledge of HOW to do all the things we KNOW are possible, we can't build as big as we dream.  Knowledge matters.  A lot.  We've learned so much in the past month (the past year!) but there's much more that we need to experience & explore.  

This Chainlink Hackathon season (only our second Chainlink Hackathon) has been a wild ride.  We've tried to stay focused on learning & building, but...there's been a lot going on.  Maybe if we had two more weeks we'd be able to pull our adaptor together and submit it.  We have a working node, a collection of interesting APIs, and assorted fragments of a project.

Gathering our assorted fragments and brushing off the dust of...all the craziness going on in the world right now...we can see that these fragments will become something really amazing...as we continue to hone the skills we need to be able to piece them together and to craft the missing bits that will hold them together.

So.  If you're a Chainlink person who happens to see this, THANK YOU for the incredible learning opportunities & materials.  THANK YOU for your time, your commitment, your insight, and your energy.  You're appreciated, and...well...WAGMI!  

We'll be back for the fall hackathon.  Last summer was spent preparing for & experiencing Chainlink Bootcamp.  This summer will be spent focusing on both fundamentals and fun, advanced Chainlink stuff.  Gotta have balance.
