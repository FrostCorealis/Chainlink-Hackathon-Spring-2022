# Chainlink-Hackathon-Spring-2022

Einstein said, "Imagination is more important than knowledge, for knowledge is limited to all we know and understand, while imagination embraces the entire world, and all there ever will be to know and understand."

Imagination opens our minds to possibilities, and is the fertile ground in which our creativity can grow & flourish.

But...just like a plant needs water & nutrients, imagination needs knowledge in order to...well...be the structure (the stem, the trunk, the foundation) for what we're building...or the flower that'll bloom...definitely mixing metaphores here.

The point it, without deep knowledge of HOW to do all the things we KNOW are possible, we can't build as big as we dream.  Knowledge matters.  A lot.  

This Chainlink Hackathon season has been a wild ride.  We've tried to stay focused on learning & building, but...there's been a lot going on.  Maybe if we had two more weeks we'd be able to pull our adaptor together and submit it.  We have a working node, a collection of interesting APIs, and fragments of a project.
